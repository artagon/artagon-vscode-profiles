# AI Profile (Crisp)

Purpose-built VS Code profile with the common AI assistant extensions (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Gemini AI Studio, Continue, Codeium, Tabnine). Use `vsp ai-profile-crisp <path>` to open a workspace with this configuration.

Setup tips:
1. Sign in to each AI extension with your provider subscription (Copilot, Claude Pro, Gemini Advanced, etc.).
2. Use the chat command center in the title bar to reach Copilot Chat, Claude, and Gemini side-by-side.
3. Run `bash ~/.config/vscode/scripts/install-extensions.sh ai-profile-crisp` after cloning on a new machine.
